"""End the action turn as soon as a user-choice menu is queued.

``ask_user_choice``, a skill's entry menu, and a skill's ``after_tool``
hook all queue the picker on the session. The loop must not take another
model step — or run bookkeeping queued after an ``after_tool`` menu in the
same response — or the model sees no answer and asks again. A hook, not an
instruction: any tool result is marked ``terminate`` when a choice is
pending, and later calls are blocked.
