"""ReAct goal gates for action and evidence-gather turns.

Builds a :class:`~core.agent.goals.Goal` whose ``verify`` rejects stop when a
host gate still applies (unfinished task plan, gather discovery-only). An
optional same-LLM review (``OPENSRE_REACT_GOAL_LLM_REVIEW=1``) can also reject
when the agent concludes after tools; default is off so the acting prompt
proposes done and these host gates accept or refuse. Two flavors share the
same verifier:

* :func:`build_goal_reviewer` — action turns ("remove the cron loops" must not
  stop after only listing them).
* :func:`build_gather_goal_reviewer` — evidence-gather turns (a data question
  must not stop at tool/schema discovery without executing the actual query;
  observed live: three PostHog turns in a row ended on MCP tool listings and
  never ran the count the user asked for).

When the LLM review is opted in it is conservative — a wrong ``NOT_REACHED``
makes the agent flail (observed live: duplicate async dispatches). It fails
open on any LLM error, runs at most once per turn, and is skipped entirely
when no tools ran, when the agent is asking the user a question, or when the
turn ran a tool whose outcome is not reviewable this turn.

The reviewer learns which tools ran through :func:`tap_executed_tool_names`
(action) or :func:`tap_executed_tool_calls` (gather — needs args so discovery
vs metric ``call_*_tool`` can be distinguished).
