# session_goal/ — `/goal` / SessionGoal component

Host-scoped completion across many `chat` turns. **Not** the ReAct
`Goal` / `turns/goal_review.py`.

## Leaves (import the leaf you need)

| Module | Owns |
|--------|------|
| `goal.py` | `SessionGoal`, statuses/reasons, attach/clear, reason derive |
| `judge.py` | Cheap-model transcript verdict (met / not yet / impossible) |
| `validate.py` | Cheap-model check of newly ticked checklist items |
| `review_input.py` | Qualifying tool observations and complete, size-limited review input |
| `evaluate.py` | Host completion: ``GOAL_REACHED`` needs evidence; ``NOT_REACHED`` continues |
| `progress.py` | `SESSION_GOAL_PROGRESS_MARK` + progress / status-line formatting |
| `continuation.py` | First-turn and continuation prompts (require a tool when none ran) |
| `persist.py` | Flush / restore payload |
| `run_until.py` | `run_until_session_goal` |

Do **not** import progress/continuation/persist/evaluate/judge/validate/run_until from
`goal.py` (avoids `py/cyclic-import`). Callers import the leaf, or curated
names from `session_goal` package `__init__`.

## Borders

- User vocabulary = `/goal` only (see progress constants).
- Attach via `/goal set`, explicit `goal=`, or structured handoff — never
  user-text keyword routing.
- Shell multi-step ≠ this component (`prompts/action/multi_step_policy.py`).
- L0/L1 evidence only couples at finalize (Want-me-to / CTA suppress).
