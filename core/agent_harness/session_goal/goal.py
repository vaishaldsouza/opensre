"""Session goal — cross-turn continuation (distinct from ReAct Goal).

Attach via an explicit host call (:func:`attach_session_goal`) or the structured
``session_goal_set`` action tool. Do not detect goals by scanning user prose.

Checklist ticks come from the ``session_goal_complete`` tool; a cheap-model
judge decides met / not yet / impossible. Reply prose never ticks or closes.

The host loop (:mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.run_until`) calls ``chat``
until the goal is achieved, impossible, cleared, cancelled, or hits a
caller-set ``max_outer_turns`` (default: no host cap; two idle turns still
stall).

Related leaf modules (import them directly — this module must not import them):

* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.evaluate` — host completion + evidence gate
* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.judge` — cheap-model transcript verdict
* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.validate` — cheap-model check of new ticks
* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.progress` — progress / status-line formatting only
* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.continuation` — session-goal continuation prompts
* :mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.persist` — flush / restore

ReAct ``core.agent.goals.Goal`` / ``goal_review`` stay the per-turn ReAct gate.
