"""SessionGoal completion — judge decides met; tools are required to accept.

The action model does not get to close the goal by saying it is done. This
module merges tool ticks, validates newly ticked items, then asks the
transcript judge (:mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.judge`).
``GOAL_REACHED`` needs tool or stored-finding evidence and a quote from
those observations when tools ran. ``NOT_REACHED``
keeps the goal active so the next turn continues — successful tools are
not enough. The judge may also veto a ``Contradiction:`` or declare
``IMPOSSIBLE``. An unrecovered tool error this turn blocks a reached
verdict. Any this-turn tool error blocks host accept when the judge is
missing. Overflowed tool evidence (``tool_evidence is None``) stays
unverified, including after ``GOAL_REACHED``. Reply prose never ticks
an item.

The judge client is injected: hosts build the loop's evaluate with
:func:`build_session_goal_evaluator`. A missing or broken judge does not
block host accept after real tools.
