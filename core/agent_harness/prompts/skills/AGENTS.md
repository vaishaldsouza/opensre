# Skill release and authoring contract

## Agents never edit SKILL.md (read this first)

Every `SKILL.md` in this tree is human-owned. Agents are **never** permitted to
create, edit, rename, move, or delete one — not a workflow step, not a
`## Plan` line, not a `metadata` field, not a one-character typo fix. "Never"
includes: the user asked for it, a colocated `test_*.py` or CI check fails
because of it, the card violates a rule in this file, or the change looks
trivial. Everything below describing how a card must be written applies to
human authors; an agent uses it only to **review** and to **suggest** — quote
the current text and the proposed text in the reply or PR description, then
leave the file untouched. Agents may still edit non-`SKILL.md` files in this
tree (catalog code, tests, `references/*.md` when not part of a card change)
under the normal rules.

## Skills are natural language; scripts are a small supporting cast

A skill's substance is its prose: activation conditions, numbered workflow
steps, completion conditions, report shape. The model reads it and reasons
its way through with the shared tool catalog. Skill-local scripts
(`scripts/<script>.py`, declared in `references/script-tools.md` and pointed
to by `script_tools:`) exist only to take one mechanical chore off the
model — fetch a payload, reshape a table, compute a count — and hand the
result back for the model to interpret.

Limits:

- **A few scripts, not many.** A skill needing more than a handful of helpers
  is describing a tool, not a skill; move that behavior into
  `integrations/<vendor>/tools/` or `tools/system/` and let the card call it.
- **No decisions in scripts.** A helper does not choose the next step, branch
  on business rules, or decide whether a step is complete. Those judgments
  stay in the workflow prose and in the model.
- **No end-to-end automation.** Chaining scripts so the workflow runs without
  the model reasoning between steps turns the skill into a deterministic
  pipeline; that is not a skill.
- **Stdlib-only, single-purpose, JSON in / JSON out** (see the `script_tools`
  contract below). A script that grows dependencies or a second purpose is a
  signal it belongs in the tool tier.

When reviewing or proposing a skill, ask whether every script could be
removed and the step still described in a sentence the model can follow. If
the skill only works because of its scripts, it is a tool wearing a card.

## Runtime modules

Keep the skills root as a public import facade and the home of workflow assets.
Catalog discovery, schema validation, names, and menus belong in `catalog/`;
Markdown resolution, body/reference loading, and index rendering belong in
`content/`; recurring revision pins belong in `scheduling/`. Consumers outside
this package import its public facade or the `scheduling` facade.

When moving a resource reader, preserve the skills root used for discovery and
include containment. Clear both catalog and index caches through
`clear_skills_caches()` when tests replace bundled resources.

## Main workflow frontmatter

`catalog/schema.py` defines the runtime schema. CI reads every raw card through
`read_skill_catalog()` and fails on any diagnostic; it must not validate only
the filtered runtime catalog. Runtime discovery logs invalid cards and excludes
them so one broken card does not prevent startup. Contributor files and report
templates are not skill entries.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Required stable lowercase kebab-case identity; unique across cards. |
| `description` | Required nonempty discovery text; state behavior and activation conditions. |
| `metadata` | Required block described below; unknown fields are rejected. |
| `getting_started`, `demo_order` | Optional pair: nonempty demo label and positive integer order. Labels and orders must be unique. |
| `includes` | Optional local Markdown files appended as instructions, once per resolved file. |
| `recurring` | Optional boolean, default `false`; enables the recurring-skill runner. Actual cron and timezone belong to the scheduled task. |
| `script_tools` | Optional pointer to `references/script-tools.md` declaring skill-local helper tools. |

Every `metadata` block requires `owner`, `last_changed_by`, `last_changed_at`,
`version`, `usecases`, and `requires`. `usecases` and `requires` are nonempty
lists of nonempty strings. CI fails when prerequisites are missing, empty, or
malformed. Quote entries containing a colon followed by a space so YAML does
not turn them into mappings. Write `version` as a quoted `MAJOR.MINOR` string
(`"2.1"`; increment rules below) and `last_changed_at` as an unquoted ISO date
no later than today.

- `usecases` names the intended user and the concrete workflow, with one entry
  per distinct scenario.
- `requires` names necessary tools, credentials, access levels, local state,
  and execution environment. State conditional requirements explicitly. For a
  skill needing no external prerequisites, say so in one entry. Never put secret
  values in the card. Metadata documents requirements; tools enforce them.
- Ownership and change tracking follow the rules below. These fields support
  human review even though they do not drive execution. This is OpenSRE's YAML
  representation of the NVIDIA skill-card use-case and requirements content;
  it does not claim to replace the full release record.

`metadata.type`, `metadata.dependencies`, `metadata.prerequisite_for`, workflow
`tools`, `pre_execute`, `after_tool`, and top-level `references` are unsupported.
Cards declare no entry hooks; see the onboarding menu paragraph below. Tool-usage
cards retain their separate schema and required `tools` field.

Put script-tool definitions in `references/script-tools.md`. Keep only the
one-line pointer `script_tools: references/script-tools.md` in `SKILL.md`
frontmatter. The runtime loads and validates the definitions from that file.

The reference's YAML frontmatter contains a `script_tools` list. Each entry has
`name`, `script` (a sibling `scripts/<script>.py` filename), `description`, and
an object `input_schema` with scalar parameters and `additionalProperties: false`.
Script helpers receive one JSON object as their first command-line argument and
emit one JSON object containing `ok`; nonzero exit is a failure. Keep helpers
stdlib-only, capture subprocess output, and return diagnostics in the result.
The host owns timeout, cancellation, and visible failure reporting. Helpers are
mutating, sequential tools; they cannot shadow the normal tool catalog. Loading
a skill changes the next request's tool list. Switching skills, settling its
plan, or starting a new request removes its helpers. Execution checks the
active session again, including for calls from an older tool snapshot.

`includes` resolves files relative to the skill directory, its parent, or the
skills root. The resolved file must stay inside the skills tree. Directories,
URLs, self-inclusion, and another `SKILL.md` are invalid. Supporting citations
remain Markdown links. Optional `references/<slug>.md` files still load on demand
through `skill_view(name=..., reference=...)`; they are not automatic includes.

The onboarding master's entry menu is not declared in its card. The loader
(`catalog/demo_menu.py`) builds it in code: the title is
`config.constants.skills.ONBOARDING_MENU_TITLE`, the options are the children's
`getting_started` labels in `demo_order` followed by the shell's Skip option,
and free text is disabled. The matching skill handoffs are generated from the
same metadata. Only implemented workflows belong in the demo menu or discovery
catalog. The generated menu must contain one to seven child choices plus Skip;
otherwise the master is excluded with a diagnostic. A child cannot reuse the
reserved Skip label. The host opens the menu on skill entry
(`tools/interactive_shell/actions/skill_entry.py`) through the real
`ask_user_choice` executor and reports `queued`, `suppressed`, or
`unavailable` under the `entry_menu` key of the `skill_view` result.

## Narrow purpose

The skill has a narrow, concrete purpose.
SKILL.md describes when the skill should activate.
Tool, shell, network, file, environment, and MCP capabilities are declared when used.

## One action per step

Each workflow step does exactly one thing and has one observable completion
condition. Split distinct actions into separate numbered steps.

Execute steps and their tool calls sequentially. Finish the current action,
including delivering any user-facing output, before starting the next.
Do not couple separate steps with wording such as "alongside", "at the same
time", or "in the same response".

The runtime enforces this per model response (`core.tool.execution`): a
response may carry **one** tool call whose role is `ACTION`; a response with
two or more executes none of them and returns the same error for each. Two
roles relax that rule, and every tool declares its role on its contract
(`ToolRole`, replacing the old `parallel_safe` flag):

- `BOOKKEEPING` (`update_plan`, `memory_remember`, `session_goal_complete`)
  may accompany the one action. Cards should say so — "mark the step
  `in_progress` in the same response as its tool call" — rather than leave
  the model to spend a solo turn on each plan write. A live run of
  `scheduling-github-ci-repairs` once spent nine solo `update_plan` turns
  (~90 s) on plan writes alone.
- `TURN_ENDING` (`ask_user_choice`) hands the turn to the user and must be
  the **only** call in its response; not even bookkeeping rides with it.
  Mark plan steps before the menu response, not in it.

Independent read-only checks inside one step (identity plus scheduler, for
example) are therefore separate responses, or one shell command that runs
both.

Report delivery and asking what to do next are separate actions: first
respond with the report as Markdown text; only after it has been shown may
the next step open a menu. Saying "the report is ready" or updating the plan
does not deliver the report. A report step that precedes further plan steps
must carry `deliverable: true` in `update_plan` (tell the card's reader to
set it); the host shows a text-only reply before the plan is settled only
when the current or next step is flagged, and treats any other one as a
premature stop.

The step that checks the outcome carries `verifies: true` (tell the card's
reader to set it). It is the only step the shell labels `(verify)`, it
completes only after its own tool returned, and a text-only last step
closes for free only after it has. A card whose last step is prose (an
explanation, a report) therefore names which earlier step verifies, or the
plan cannot be marked complete.

Do not apply that teaching to onboarding demo A
(`onboarding-github-ci/a-analyzing-github-ci-performance/`). Leave the card,
references, and workflow script as they are on `main`. Still run
`test_workflow.py` when the host or skill loader changes; if it fails, fix
the product or the harness, not the card. Demos B and C are not frozen.

## Default recommended plan

Every workflow `SKILL.md` carries a `## Plan` section directly after its
purpose statement and before `## Workflow`. It is the default plan the agent
loads into the live plan via `update_plan` as soon as it reads the skill, so
the user sees the whole flow up front and progress is tracked per step.

The section has two parts:

1. A short paragraph telling the agent to call `update_plan` to create or
   revise the named live plan from the steps below, keep reporting and
   follow-up as separate plan items, mark already-satisfied steps
   `completed`, and update statuses as each step's completion condition is
   met.
2. A checklist with one `- [ ] Step N. …` line per numbered `## Workflow`
   heading, in the same order and with the same count. Each line names the
   step's outcome and the tool it uses (`scan_local_git_workspace`,
   `ask_user_choice`, …) in one sentence.

Example shape for a workflow with eight separate steps:

```markdown
## Plan

After reading this skill, use `update_plan` to create or revise the live
CI/CD Reliability Progress plan using the eight numbered workflow headings
below as its steps. Keep reporting and follow-up as separate plan items.
Mark already-satisfied steps `completed` and update statuses when each
step's completion condition is met.

- [ ] Step 1. Scan local repositories with scan_local_git_workspace.
- [ ] Step 2. Select a repository using ask_user_choice.
- [ ] Step 3. Read the metric and benchmark references with skill_view.
- [ ] Step 4. Collect complete 30-day workflow, rerun, and merged-PR history.
- [ ] Step 5. Calculate the required metrics from the collected history.
- [ ] Step 6. Validate the calculations against the coverage and consistency requirements.
- [ ] Step 7. Respond with the report as a Markdown table and its coverage notes.
- [ ] Step 8. After the report is shown, use ask_user_choice to offer the next step.
```

Rules:

- The plan and the `## Workflow` headings are one list in two places. Adding,
  removing, or reordering a workflow step changes the plan in the same edit;
  a skill whose plan and headings disagree is incomplete.
- Each workflow step states its completion condition ("Complete when …") so
  the agent can move the matching plan item to `completed` without guessing.
- Steps the flow may legitimately skip (for example a repository already
  named in the request) say so in the step body and tell the agent to mark
  the skipped plan items satisfied rather than delete them.
- Tool-usage cards describe one call, not a flow, and do not carry a plan.

## Colocated workflow tests

Major skills that orchestrate a multi-step workflow must keep an end-to-end
`test_*.py` beside their `SKILL.md`. Exercise the real agent loop with the
shipped skill, checking tool-call order, arguments, and user-choice pauses.
Script model responses and external tool I/O for offline CI; keep skill loading
and host hooks real. Include the skill directory in default pytest discovery
and a CI shard, and run its test when changing the workflow.

These files sit inside `core/`, so the layer contracts apply to them: never
import `tools`, `integrations`, `surfaces`, or `bootstrap`. Resolve real action
tools (`ask_user_choice`, `skill_view`) through
`core.agent_harness.tools.action_tools.get_action_tool`; the registry behind it
is installed around every test by `tests/harness_providers_plugin.py`
(loaded from `pytest.ini`), not by `tests/conftest.py`, which does not reach
this tree.


## Skill metadata ownership, change date, and version

Every `SKILL.md` frontmatter `metadata` block records who owns the skill, who
touched it last, when, and which revision of the card this is:

- `owner` — the person who created the skill. Use their name, never a team
  label such as `Tracer Team`. Set it once at creation and do not change it
  when someone else edits the skill later.
- `last_changed_by` — the name of the person who most recently changed the
  skill.
- `last_changed_at` — the calendar date of that change as an unquoted ISO
  date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). No times, no timezones, no "today" — a reader must be
  able to tell how stale the card is without opening `git log`.
- `version` — a quoted `MAJOR.MINOR` string. Every edit adds one to the
  number behind the dot: `"2.1"` → `"2.2"` → … → `"2.9"` → `"2.10"` → `"2.15"`.
  The minor part is a counter, not a decimal, so `"2.10"` follows `"2.9"` and
  it never resets on its own. The number before the dot does not move for
  routine work — wording, step reordering, new checks, a bigger report. Bump
  it (and reset the minor part to `.0`) only when the card breaks something
  outside itself: a rename, a changed or removed entry-menu question, or a
  removed workflow step that a persisted schedule or colocated test depends
  on. A history like `1.2 → 2.0 → 3.0 → 4.0 → 5.0` for ordinary edits is
  wrong; it should read `1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6`.

`last_changed_by`, `last_changed_at`, and `version` move together. Whoever
edits a skill (body or frontmatter) must update all three lines in the same
change; a skill edit that leaves any of them behind is incomplete. Do not
backfill the date from memory when you are not the one who made the change —
take it from `git log -1 --format=%ad --date=short -- <SKILL.md>`.

```yaml
metadata:
  owner: Vincent
  last_changed_by: Jan
  last_changed_at: 2026-09-09
  version: "2.2"
```

`tests/core/agent_harness/prompts/test_skill_metadata.py` fails a card whose
`last_changed_at` is missing, not a date, or in the future.

When you touch a skill that still carries a team label in `owner`, replace it
with the original author's name if you know it; otherwise leave it and note it
in the PR description rather than guessing.

## Where a card lives

Two kinds of card, two homes, and a `name` exists in exactly one of them:

- **Workflow** — a multi-step flow the agent follows (when to activate, sibling
  carve-outs, ordered steps, a report template, a schedule offer). Lives here:
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with the `metadata` block above. It gets one line
  in the always-on skills index and its full body via `skill_view`. Workflow
  cards keep the available tool catalog; they do not declare a tool filter.
  List required tools in `metadata.requires`.
- **Tool usage** — how to call one tool or one tool family correctly:
  parameter selection, refusals, what the tool owns so the agent does not run
  raw `gh`/`git` around it. Lives next to the tool package
  (`integrations/<vendor>/tools/…/SKILL.md`,
  `tools/system/…/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) with `tools:` frontmatter, and is
  appended to those tools' descriptions at registry load
  (`tools/registry_skill_guidance.py`, 2,400-char cap). Register the path in
  `_skill_guidance_files()`.

The same tool may have both — `operating-github-ci-fixer` (tool usage, beside
`fix_github_pr_ci`) and `repair-github-ci` (workflow, here) — but they are two
cards with two names and two jobs. Tool-level facts (fork PRs are refused,
merged PRs need `branch`) belong in the tool-usage card; activation phrases,
sibling carve-outs, and reply shape belong in the workflow. Never give two
cards the same `name`.

## Naming conventions

The `name` field is the skill's identity: `catalog/registry.py` rejects duplicates, the
scheduler pins on it, and users type it (`opensre cron add --skill …`). Pick it
once, following these rules, and treat a rename as a breaking change.

1. **Shape is `<verb-ing>-<object>`** — gerund first, then what it acts on,
   2–4 hyphenated lowercase words. The verb says what the agent does; the
   object says to what. `reporting-github-ci-failures`, `summarizing-sentry-issues`.
   The CI repair family is the one defined exception: it uses the bare stem
   `repair` — `repair-github-ci` for the one-off action and `…-repairs` as the
   object of skills that act on it (`scheduling-github-ci-repairs`). Do not
   add other bare-verb names; extend this rule first if a second family needs
   one.
2. **Vendor is an adjective on the object, never a prefix.**
   `reporting-github-ci-failures`, not `github-ci-health` or
   `github-reporting-ci-failures`. Every GitHub
   skill stays searchable by `-github-` while the leading word still names
   the activity.
3. **No artifact suffixes.** Do not append `-demo`, `-agent`, `-tool`,
   `-service`, `-skill`, `-report`. Demo status lives in `getting_started` /
   `demo_order` frontmatter; recurrence lives in `recurring`. The name must
   survive the skill graduating out of the demo menu.
4. **Only implemented workflows are discoverable.** Keep roadmap placeholders
   outside the skill catalog and selectable demo menu. The one sanctioned
   exception is demo C, `delegating-github-ci-repairs`: its menu label says
   "(coming soon)", its body tells the user the managed service is not
   available yet and points at what works today, and it calls no tool. Do not
   add a second placeholder; graduate this one when the service ships.
5. **Disambiguate siblings by verb, not by qualifier.** Two skills over the
   same object must differ in what they do: `reporting-github-ci-failures`
   (what is red now) vs `analyzing-github-ci-performance` (trend over a
   period); `repair-github-ci` (one repair) vs `scheduling-github-ci-repairs`
   (setting up recurring repair).
   If you need a "Not for X, use Y" sentence in the description, first check
   whether a better verb pair removes the need.
6. **Directory name equals `name`** (kebab-case) for a dedicated skill
   directory, e.g. `skills/repair-github-ci/SKILL.md`. A tool-usage card
   inside a Python tool package (`integrations/github/tools/github_cli/`)
   keeps the package's snake_case directory; only its frontmatter `name`
   follows this convention. The sibling report template is
   `<directory>_report.md`. A child of a nested tree (the onboarding demos)
   is `<letter>-<name>/`, where the single lowercase letter is the menu
   position (`a` ⇔ `demo_order: 1`) and everything after the first hyphen
   equals `name`: `onboarding-github-ci/a-analyzing-github-ci-performance/`.
   The letter orders siblings on disk and in the skills index; `demo_order`
   orders the menu, and `tests/core/agent/prompts/test_skills_demo.py` fails
   when the two disagree or the suffix drifts from `name`.
7. **Scheduler and telemetry keys are not skill names.** Starter-loop slugs,
   telemetry event names, and task-store params may reference a skill but
   must not be derived from its `name`, so a rename does not break stored
   tasks or dashboards. Read skill names from one constant where product
   code branches on them.
8. **Renaming a skill adds its old slug to `LEGACY_SKILL_NAMES`** in
   `skills/catalog/naming.py`. Persisted recurring schedules store the `name` they
   were confirmed with; the map lets `find_action_skill` and `skill_view`
   resolve the old slug, and the scheduler re-pins such a task to the new
   name on its next tick. A tool-usage card beside a tool also needs its
   path updated in `_skill_guidance_files()` — `tests/tools/test_registry.py`
   fails on a stale path.

Sanctioned verbs (add a new one here before using it): `analyzing`,
`connecting`, `delegating`, `delivering`, `fixing`, `investigating`,
`measuring`, `onboarding`, `operating`, `querying`, `reporting`,
`scheduling`, `summarizing`, `tracking`; plus the bare stem `repair` for the
CI repair family (rule 1).

Avoid: vague objects (`helper`, `utils`, `tools`, `data`, `files`), reserved
prefixes (`anthropic-`, `claude-`), and mixing patterns across the collection.

`delegating-github-ci-fixes` (now `delegating-github-ci-repairs`) live on only
in `LEGACY_SKILL_NAMES`; do not reuse them.
