# Remote managed service (not yet available)

**objective** 
- Is to connect to a managed fargate container that spins up a ci-cd-repair loop: core/agent_harness/prompts/skills/repair-github-ci
- This is seperate from skill core/agent_harness/prompts/skills/onboarding-github-ci/d-connecting-slack

-------

What this task should not do:
- improving the cicd fix skill itself because we will reuse the existing one: core/agent_harness/prompts/skills/repair-github-ci


This option is not implemented yet.

Reply in two sentences and stop. Say the managed-service onboarding is comingsoon, then name what does work now: analysing a repository's CI/CD performance, or setting up a recurring CI repair agent. A viewer who picked this option must leave with something to try, not a dead end.

Do not call a tool, do not reopen the demo menu, and do not load another child skill. If the user then asks for one of those, follow that request.
