  - For repository maintainers analyzing CI reliability over the previous 30 days.
  - For engineering teams assessing estimated developer waiting time and failure patterns.
  - For new users selecting a local or example repository for a CI performance demonstration.
  requires:
  - GitHub authentication with read access to the repository's Actions history.
  - The analyze_github_ci_reliability and scan_local_git_workspace tools.
  - For local discovery, a local Git checkout; the example repository does not require one.

# CI/CD analytics

Give the user a CI/CD reliability report for one repository from raw GitHub Actions records, including an estimate of CI waiting time on merged pull requests.

Use a 30-day window unless the request specifies another period.

## Plan

After reading this skill, use `update_plan` to create or revise the live
CI/CD Reliability Progress plan using the six numbered workflow headings
below as its steps.

Keep showing the table and offering the next step as separate plan items; update statuses as each step's completion condition is met.

Mark step 5 with `deliverable: true` in every `update_plan` call: its work is
the reply itself, and without that flag the host treats a text-only reply
before the plan is settled as a premature stop and does not show it.

- [ ] Step 1. Scan local repositories with scan_local_git_workspace.
- [ ] Step 2. Select a repository using ask_user_choice.
- [ ] Step 3. Collect and compute the 30-day metrics with analyze_github_ci_reliability.
- [ ] Step 4. Prepare the metrics table as Markdown text from the benchmarks reference.
- [ ] Step 5. Show the metrics table as a text-only reply.
- [ ] Step 6. Use ask_user_choice to offer scheduling, Slack setup, or finish.

## Workflow

### 1. Scan this machine

Call `scan_local_git_workspace()` with no arguments.

Complete when `scan_local_git_workspace` has returned in this turn, even
with an empty result; the example repository remains available in step 2.

### 2. Pick the repository

Call `ask_user_choice` with the title `Which repository should I analyze?`.
Offer up to 5 scanned repositories that have GitHub Actions workflows
as `<owner/repo>`, then `Tracer-Cloud/opensre` as an example option.
Offer the picker even when only one repository was found; a single scan
result is not a selection.

End the turn after calling `ask_user_choice`; the answer arrives as the
next user message.

Complete when the user's answer to `ask_user_choice` has arrived as a
message. Resume at step 3 with that repository.

### 3. Collect and compute the metrics

Call `analyze_github_ci_reliability(owner="<owner>", repo="<repo>", days=30)`.
It reads the whole window of Actions history (default-branch runs, PR runs,
rerun attempts, merged PRs), computes every metric in the report, and returns
figures only: `headline`, `key_results`, `comparison_figures` (the repository's
column of the comparison table), `benchmarks` (the peer columns),
`coverage_notices`, and the raw counts. It renders nothing; the report below
is yours to write. Do not paginate the REST API or run `execute_python_code`
yourself.

If the tool reports a missing token, tell the user to run `opensre integrations setup github` and carry that blocker into step 4 as a coverage gap.

Metric definitions live in [Metrics](references/metrics.md)
(`skill_view(name="analyzing-github-ci-performance", reference="metrics")`); read it only
when the user asks how a figure is defined.

Complete when `analyze_github_ci_reliability` has returned in this turn,
either with `key_results` or with a named blocker.

### 4. Prepare a metrics table as Markdown text

Read [Benchmarks](references/benchmarks.md) via
`skill_view(name="analyzing-github-ci-performance", reference="benchmarks")` now for
the comparison values and their interpretation limits. Check each table
cell against a calculation result or this reference.

If a cell has no source in the step 3 result or this reference, return to
step 3: reread `coverage_notices` for the named gap, and if the analysis did
not return success, run it again once. A cell still without a source is
`n/a` with the gap stated under the table; never estimate it.

Prepare the report below for delivery in step 5.

#### Report format

Identify the repository, default branch, UTC window, and coverage. Render
this table as text, replacing every placeholder with a calculated value or a
benchmark from the reference:

```
Developer impact:
- xx developer-hours spent waiting on CI across xx developers.
- Most affected developer: up to xx h/week waiting on CI.
- xx% of PR runs failed, creating substantial retry and investigation overhead.

Compared with langchain-ai/langchain and anomalyco/opencode:

| Metric | <owner/repo> | langchain-ai/langchain | anomalyco/opencode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Red time on main | <hours and % of window> | <benchmark> | <benchmark> |
| Mean time to green | <hours> | <benchmark> | <benchmark> |
| CI-caused failure rate | <% of PR workflow runs> | <benchmark> | <benchmark> |
| Slowest normal run | <minutes and workflow> | <benchmark> | <benchmark> |
| PR failure rate | <% of PR workflow runs> | <benchmark> | <benchmark> |

What insights stand out:
- CI-caused failures account for x.x% of all PR runs, roughly x.x-x.x× higher than the comparison repositories.
```

Complete when `skill_view` has returned the benchmarks reference in this
turn and every table cell has a source or is `n/a` with its gap stated.

### 5. Show the metrics table

Reply with the step 4 report as Markdown text and nothing else; call no
tool in that message. The host paints that reply and then continues the
plan with step 6 — do not repeat the report afterwards.

Complete when the assistant reply containing the table has been shown.

### 6. Offer the next step

Call `ask_user_choice` with the title
`What would you like to do next?` and these options:

- Schedule local loops
- Slack setup
- Finish

Complete when the `ask_user_choice` call for this menu has returned in
this turn. The user's answer arrives in the next turn. Each branch except
`Finish` is owned by a sibling skill: load it with `skill_view` and follow
its plan; do not reimplement its steps here.

- **Schedule local loops:** call `skill_view(name="scheduling-github-ci-repairs")`
  and follow that skill. The repository is already chosen and analyzed in
  this session, so its plan omits the scan and repository-pick steps and
  its analyze step reuses today's saved report.
- **Slack setup:** call `skill_view(name="connecting-slack")` and follow that
  skill.
- **Finish:** acknowledge in one line and conclude.
