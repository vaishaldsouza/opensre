# <Workflow title>

<State the concrete outcome.>

## Plan

Use `update_plan` to track the numbered workflow steps below. Keep already
satisfied steps and mark them completed. Update each status when its completion
condition is met. Mark the step that checks the outcome with `verifies: true`;
a text-only last step closes only after it has run.

- [ ] Step 1. <Resolve the required inputs using the owning tool.>
- [ ] Step 2. <Perform the work with the named tool.>
- [ ] Step 3. <Check the outcome with the named tool; this step carries `verifies: true`.>
- [ ] Step 4. <Deliver the outcome.>

## Workflow

### 1. <Resolve inputs>

<Use known scope, ask only for missing decisions, and name the tool that checks
prerequisites. List the conditions under which this step is already satisfied.>

Complete when <observable input and prerequisite condition>.

### 2. <Perform the work>

<Name the execution tool and the required arguments. Put branch-specific
reference material behind an explicit link and state when to read it.>

Complete when <observable tool result>.

### 3. <Deliver the outcome>

<State the output format and evidence required to support the result.>

Complete when <the user has received the result>.
