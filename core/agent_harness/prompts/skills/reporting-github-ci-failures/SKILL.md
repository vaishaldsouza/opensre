  Read-only GitHub CI health report of the checks failing right now for one repository, optionally narrowed
  to a branch or pull request. Not for CI/CD performance, reliability KPIs, failure rates, or downtime
  over a period (use analyzing-github-ci-performance).

  usecases:
  - For maintainers checking which CI checks are failing now in one repository, branch, or PR.
  - For teams receiving recurring CI failure reports at a chosen destination.
  requires:
  - GitHub authentication with read access to the target repository.
  - Explicit repository owner and name for scheduled execution.
  - For recurring delivery, a configured scheduler and destination.

# GitHub CI health

Use this skill to report failing CI checks for exactly one configured GitHub
repository. The schedule must supply `owner` and `repo`; it may supply either
`branch` or `pr_number`, never both.

The scheduled runner supplies a pre-fetched CI health block. Treat that block
as the complete source of truth and return it faithfully as the final report;
do not discover a broader organization or repository scope. Preserve every
failing check, link, age, responsible PR or branch, coverage notice, and repair
handoff in the block.

## Tool usage

This skill does not issue GitHub tool calls during unattended execution. Before
the skill runs, the scheduled runner invokes `run_github_ci_health`, which
collects the configured repository's CI data through read-only GitHub REST GET
requests and supplies the complete rendered report.

Do not perform additional or fallback GitHub discovery. The only interactive
tool used by this skill is `propose_scheduled_delivery`, which configures the
recurring report and is never called during an unattended run.

This workflow is read-only. Never call `fix_github_pr_ci`, `github_cli`,
`shell_run`, or any other mutating or external-command tool during unattended
execution. Repairs must be requested interactively and explicitly approved.

When offering this report as a recurring task interactively, use kind
`recurring_skill` and skill name `reporting-github-ci-failures`. Pass the exact `owner` and
`repo`, plus at most one of `branch` or `pr_number`, to
`propose_scheduled_delivery` so confirmation preserves the repository scope.

Interactively, the repository comes from the request; when it names none,
call `scan_local_git_workspace` and ask with `ask_user_choice`. Never run
`cli_exec` (`opensre health`, `opensre integrations …`), `shell_run`, or
`github_cli` to discover the repository, the token, or the environment: they
print unrelated integration state and are not part of this skill. To show
the checks failing right now during an interactive turn, use
`summarize_github_pr_status`; this skill's own report is produced by the
scheduled runner only.
