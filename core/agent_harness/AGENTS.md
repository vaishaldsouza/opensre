# agent_harness/ package rules

## SKILL.md files are off-limits to agents

Agents must **never** modify any `SKILL.md` under this tree
(`prompts/skills/**/SKILL.md`) or anywhere else in the repository — no edits,
creations, renames, moves, or deletions, and no frontmatter-only bumps. Agents
may only **suggest** changes in prose (current text → proposed text) for a
human to apply. This is absolute; a failing test, a user instruction, or a
seemingly trivial fix does not lift it. See the root `AGENTS.md`.

Skills are natural-language workflow cards the model reasons through, not
deterministic tools. A skill may ship a few small supporting scripts
(`script_tools`), each doing one mechanical chore whose output the model then
interprets. Decision-making, branching, and end-to-end automation belong in
the card's prose steps or in a real tool (`integrations/`, `tools/`) — never
in a growing pile of skill-local scripts. Full contract: `prompts/skills/AGENTS.md`.

`agent_harness/` is the decoupled host for the single `core.agent.Agent` ReAct
loop: the same model calls tools, observes results, and writes the final answer.
It was extracted out of `interactive_shell` so the same harness can run the
interactive terminal and be invoked headlessly via
`agent_harness.turns.headless_agent`.

## Prompt capture

`turns.orchestrator.run_turn` owns prompt capture for every host through
`infrastructure.analytics.prompt_log.lifecycle`. Keep one recorder per dispatch,
including continuations, and restore parent correlation after nested turns.
Hosts enrich the active recorder; only the shared lifecycle flushes it.

## Host API (teach this)

Prefer `AgentSession.start()` / `start_embedded_session()` → `.chat` —
not free-function turn dumps. Construct one agent per logical
session (or scheduled loop), then many turns — do not rebuild every message.
Process boot (`configure_process`) and headless construction
(`DefaultHeadlessBuild.agent`) are separate layers. `core` must not import
`bootstrap`; embedded hosts use `bootstrap.embedded.start_embedded_session`.

| Path | Call |
|------|------|
| Process boot (once) | `configure_process(PROFILE)` — adapters only; not agent construction |
| Happy path (already booted) | `AgentSession.start()` → repeated `.chat` |
| Embedded / script | `start_embedded_session()` → repeated `.chat` |
| Multi-step / keep-going | `start` / `start_embedded_session` → `.chat_until_goal(...)` (`SessionGoal` loop) |
| Custom host | **`DefaultHeadlessBuild(...).agent(...)`** (or `InMemoryHeadlessBuild` in-memory; the only construction seam) → `agent.handle(text, TurnBinding(...))` per message |
| Gateway + interactive shell | `TurnRunner` → `SessionAgentPool` → `DefaultHeadlessBuild.agent` once / session → `agent.handle(...)` per message (SessionGoal loop lives in `run_goal`, which `handle` wraps) |
| CLI `ask` (one-shot) | `AgentSession.start(..., tool_hooks=…)` → `.chat(prompt)` — uses `dispatch`, not the SessionGoal turn loop |
| Host-specific construction | Optional `AgentBuildConfig` (`agent_build_config.py`) — tools / prompts / capability policy. Expand with `resolve_agent_ports` (shared by the pool and `build_shell_agent`). `None` on a field keeps the host default; `apply_capability_policy=None` means do not mutate the session |
| Scheduled one-shot | `AgentSession.run_headless_turn(...)` (not the multi-turn pattern) |

`SessionGoal` (`session_goal/` component — `goal` + `run_until`) is
**not** the ReAct `Goal` / `goal_review`. User-facing word is `/goal` only
(show / set / pause / resume / edit / clear). Status `paused` stops session-goal
continuation but keeps state; `host_owned` blocks handoff replace while
**active or paused**. While a goal is **attached** (active or paused),
`run_turn` suppresses Want-me-to closers. Completion is judged by
`session_goal/evaluate.py`, independent of model self-report: checklist items
are ticked only through the `session_goal_complete` tool (a cheap-model
validator in `session_goal/validate.py` can refuse a tick), and a cheap-model
transcript judge (`session_goal/judge.py`) returns met / not yet / impossible
with a reason. Reviewers receive the complete reply and actual tool observations
retained across turns and restore; oversized input stays unverified. Unvalidated
ticks are rolled back, and a configured judge must approve even a completed
checklist. `met` still needs successful non-bookkeeping tool work this turn or
retained evidence from earlier turns.
The judge client is injected: `HeadlessAgent(judge_llm_factory=…)`
builds the loop's evaluate with `evaluate.build_session_goal_evaluator`;
`DefaultHeadlessBuild` passes the classification-tier factory, in-memory
builds pass none (only a fully ticked checklist closes a goal). Host reason
strings live in `SessionGoalReason`. Reason derive:
`session_goal.goal.derive_session_goal_reason`. Progress (presentation only):
`session_goal/progress.py` (`SESSION_GOAL_PROGRESS_MARK`). Continuation prompts:
`session_goal/continuation.py`. Flush/restore: `session_goal/persist.py`.
Package rules: `session_goal/AGENTS.md`. Borders SoT (local notes):
`opensre-notes/goal-core-system-design-aug2026.html`.

**Task plan guards (host-enforced, `task_plan/`):** a plan write cannot
complete a step that had no tool return while it was `in_progress`
(`task_plan/completion.py`, fed by `turns/plan_hooks.py`); a step marked
`verifies` is never exempt, and a text-only closing step is exempt only once
such a step completed. The second work tool of a turn with no open plan is
refused (`task_plan/required.py`). A step newly marked `blocked` is resolved
with the user, not skipped: the conclusion is rejected until `ask_user_choice`
is queued (`task_plan/conclusion.py`, gate in `turns/goal_review.py`). The
onboarding menu's answer turn that only loaded the chosen demo skill is
rejected once, with a nudge to write the plan and run its first step (same
files). Change the rule in the
owning leaf, never by prompt text alone.

**Evidence kinds (open/closed):** vocabulary + per-kind policy live in
`turns/evidence_kind.py` (`EvidenceKind` + `EvidenceKindPolicy`). Add a kind by
extending the enum and registering its policy row — do **not** grow
`if kind is …` branches in `classify_evidence_need`. Tool schema `enum` is
`EVIDENCE_KIND_VALUES` (derived), not a parallel hard-coded list. Preferred
integration ids stay opt-in via `infrastructure.harness_providers.register_preferred_evidence_source`.

**Evidence kinds:** vocabulary + per-kind policy still live in
`turns/evidence_kind.py`. `classify_evidence_need` is connectivity-first
(`L0_degraded` when a preferred authoritative source is missing) so the
assistant can emit a setup CTA. There is no second gather ReAct loop on the
chat path — the action agent owns tools.

**No keyword intent routing around the agent.** Do not scan user text with
regex/keywords to attach goals or bypass the ReAct loop. Session goals attach
through the structured `session_goal_set` tool or explicit host APIs.
Checklist progress uses the `session_goal_complete` tool, not reply tags.

Workflow cards are validated before discovery. Invalid cards are excluded with
diagnostics, while CI checks the unfiltered catalog and fails on every invalid
card. Workflow skills retain the available tool catalog and may add declared
local script tools while active. The per-run catalog refreshes after skill
changes; execution rechecks the active session. Settling the plan retires its
helpers. A new user request clears active skill context, while menu answers
and slash commands retain it. Full contract: `prompts/skills/AGENTS.md`.

Self-contained scheduled agent ticks set `SessionCore.skill_discovery_enabled`
to `False` through `prepare_session`. This host-owned policy removes the skill
index and `skill_view` while retaining execution tools; never infer it from
prompt text or restore it from conversation history.

Do **not** duplicate the default port stack outside `DefaultHeadlessBuild`.
Expand `AgentBuildConfig` through `resolve_agent_ports` — do not re-copy the
`build_tools` / `build_prompts` branch in each host. Gateway
chat and the interactive shell share `TurnRunner` + `SessionAgentPool`
(`build_shell_agent` remains for tests / direct construction). Do not
reintroduce peer `bootstrap.adapters` copies under surfaces or gateway.

**Bind ports:** session-aware defaults implement
`SessionBindable` / `ConsoleBindable` / `OutputBindable` (`ports.py`).
`HeadlessAgent.bind_session` / `bind_turn(console=…, output=…)` only call ports
that match those Protocols. Gateway usually keeps a stable `BindableOutput` and
rebinds the transport via `BindableOutput.bind` (no `output=` each turn).
The mutable session port is **`SessionState`** (field `HeadlessAgent._session`,
headless impl `InMemorySessionState`) — not `SessionStore`. Durable JSONL is
`SessionStore` / `SessionRepo` (`docs/NAMING.md`).

**Host cancel:** one `threading.Event` on the output sink
(`ensure_turn_cancel` / `host_cancel_requested` in `turns/host_cancel.py`) —
tools (console `cancel_requested`), orchestrator, and stream guards all
read that same Event. Do not invent a second cancel channel.

**Cloud scale-out:** more Fargate tasks (fleet), not unbound in-process
concurrency or a new `chat` API.

## Hard boundary

- **No `import interactive_shell` anywhere under `agent_harness/`.** The dependency
  direction is strictly one-way: `interactive_shell -> agent_harness -> core`.
- `agent_harness/` may depend on `core/`, `config/`, and `infrastructure/`. It must not
  import `integrations/`, `tools/`, `surfaces/`, or `gateway/`. Integration and tool
  behavior reaches the harness through the providers in `infrastructure/harness_providers/`, wired at
  startup via `install_harness_providers()` in the interactive-shell output boundary.
  It must not depend on terminal UI concerns (Rich rendering, prompt-toolkit
  mutable UI state, slash dispatch, the shell `REGISTRY`).

## Layout

Top level holds the package's public surface — `__init__.py` (the curated
re-exports), `ports.py`, `agent_builder.py` — plus two small cross-cutting default
port impls that fit no single subpackage: `error_reporting.py`
(`DefaultErrorReporter`) and `llm_resolution.py` (`default_llm_factory` /
`resolve_provider_models`). Everything else lives in a responsibility-scoped
subpackage. Default port implementations live with the concern they serve, not in a
`providers/` package.

- `ports.py` — Protocols the engine talks to (output, confirmation, session
  store, tool provider, prompt-context provider, telemetry, error reporter,
  telemetry). Kept top-level as the central seam imported everywhere.
- `agent_builder.py` — `AgentConfig` dataclass + `build_agent(config)`. The
  single instantiation site for `core.agent.Agent` across all surfaces
  (action, evidence, gateway). See "Agent construction pattern" below.
- `turns/` — the turn drivers that orchestrate `core.agent.Agent`:
  - `orchestrator.py` — `run_turn` sequences three seams (do not merge them):
    1. **route decide** — pure `turn_route.route_turn` (no I/O, no stream flags)
    2. **route execute** — summarize / handled / answer effects
    3. **answer finalize** — `answer_finalize.finalize_routed_answer` (CTA,
       Want-me-to, stream flush). Stream rewrite locals
       (`text_changed_after_streaming`) stay inside finalize and must **never**
       gate route selection.
    Resolves base integrations **once** at the top of the turn, enriches that
    per-turn copy with repository scopes from the frozen message/history, and
    stores the enriched view on `turn_snapshot`. One active scope per vendor
    drives unqualified tool calls while the session retains a bounded collection
    of every repository scope it has encountered. Thus
    `turn_snapshot.resolved_integrations` is
    the single source of truth for what the turn knows without mutating the
    session's base integration cache. Downstream components (e.g.
    `action_driver._resolved_integrations_for_turn`) read it from there rather
    than re-resolving. Do NOT reintroduce per-component integration resolution.
  - `turn_route.py` / `answer_finalize.py` / `handoff_policy.py` — the seams
    above, extracted so post-answer bookkeeping cannot regress into routing.
  - `SessionGoal` vs local shell multi-step are also separate concerns:
    prompt fragments in `prompts/action/multi_step_policy.py`.
  - `action_driver.py` — `ActionTurnRunner`: one action tool-calling turn
    over the ports, via a `_build_action_agent` factory that returns an
    `ActionTurnPlan`.
  - `headless_agent.py` — headless programmatic entry point
    (`HeadlessAgent`, built by a port family; `.handle(text, binding)` per message, `.dispatch` underneath)
    plus in-memory port adapters for
    API / test runs. `tools` is required — surfaces that want a text-only
    turn pass `NullToolProvider()` explicitly.
  - `turn_snapshot.py` / `turn_results.py` — the immutable per-turn `TurnSnapshot`
    (built from any object satisfying `TurnSnapshotSource`, not `Session` directly)
    and the neutral turn-result models.
- `tools/` — action-tool wiring over the canonical registry (`action_tools.py`,
  `tool_context.py`) and `tool_provider.py` (`DefaultToolProvider`).
- `accounting/` — session-scoped token accounting and the default
  `TurnAccounting` (`turn_accounting.py`).
- `prompts/` — the single agent's prompt assembly. Layout: `kernel/`
  (envelope + surface Strategy), `action/` (assembler), `grounding/`
  (prompt providers), plus leaves `memory/` / `runtime_facts/` / `skills/`.
- `grounding/` — reusable grounding cache and rendering contracts; surfaces
  inject surface-owned command registries instead of being imported here.
- `session/` — reusable agent session state (`SessionCore`), JSONL storage, prompt
  history, task registry, session-scoped background records, integration resolution
  (:mod:`session.integration_resolution`), and `SessionManager` (the lifecycle owner).
  See "Session lifecycle" below.
- `session_goal/` — `/goal` / SessionGoal component (`SessionGoal` across many `chat`
  turns): `goal`, `evaluate` / `confirm`, `progress` / `continuation`, `persist`,
  `run_until`. **Not** the ReAct `Goal` / `turns/goal_review.py`. See
  `session_goal/AGENTS.md`.

## Session lifecycle (owned by SessionManager)

`core.agent_harness.session.SessionManager` is the single owner of session
create / resolve / rotate / restore / flush. Every surface delegates lifecycle
to it instead of re-implementing bootstrap + persistence:

- **shell** — `SessionBootstrapSpec` calls `SessionManager().bootstrap(...)` for
  the core startup mutations (persistent task registry + integration
  hydration), then layers shell-only UI concerns (theme, grounding providers,
  prompt history) on top. Interactive REPL entry calls
  :meth:`SessionManager.open_storage` once the run is confirmed interactive;
  ``/new`` calls :meth:`SessionManager.rotate_in_place`; ``/resume`` calls
  :meth:`SessionManager.rebind_for_resume` then :meth:`SessionManager.restore_context`.
  REPL exit calls :meth:`SessionManager.close` via
  :meth:`SessionManager.for_session`.
- **gateway** — process boot is
  :func:`bootstrap.process.configure_process` (``GATEWAY_PROFILE``);
  `GatewayController` stays lifecycle-only (credentials → process boot →
  transports). Per-chat session create/resolve stays on
  `gateway/core/storage/session/resolver.py::SessionResolver` →
  `SessionManager`. Turn dispatch uses `HeadlessAgent` via
  `infrastructure/turn_host/turn_runner.py`'s `TurnRunner` with
  :class:`~core.agent_harness.tools.tool_provider.DefaultToolProvider`
  built from the **live per-chat session** each turn (same tool resolution as
  shell). There is no separate gateway-owned ``Agent`` instance.
- **headless / scheduled** — non-TTY hosts use
  :meth:`AgentSession.run_headless_turn` (or ``start`` + ``chat``).
  That is the same ``run_turn`` engine as the shell; do not reassemble
  ``BufferOutputSink`` + ``DefaultHeadlessBuild`` in integrations.
  Ephemeral in-memory sessions (``headless_adapters.InMemorySessionState``)
  bypass ``SessionManager`` by design when tests need no JSONL.

`Session` (formerly `ReplSession`) is the in-memory session object used by every
surface, including headless gateway — it is not REPL-specific. Do not re-add
per-surface session bootstrap logic; extend `SessionManager` instead.

## Agent construction pattern (Pattern A — canonical)

Every surface builds its runtime `Agent` the same way: assemble surface-specific
values into an `AgentConfig` dataclass, then call `build_agent(config)`. This is
the single instantiation site — when `Agent.__init__`'s signature changes,
`agent_builder.py` is the single edit site for every harness surface.

1. Assemble surface-specific values (LLM, system prompt, tools, resolved
   integrations, iteration cap, observer).
2. Pack them into an `AgentConfig` dataclass.
3. Hand it to `build_agent(config)`.

```python
from core.agent_harness.agent_builder import AgentConfig, build_agent

config = AgentConfig(
    llm=llm_client,
    system=system_prompt,
    tools=tuple(agent_tools),
    resolved_integrations=resolved,
    max_iterations=6,
    tool_resources={},  # optional
    tool_hooks=None,  # optional
    on_runtime_event=observer_callback,  # optional
)
agent = build_agent(config)
```

Action (`turns/action_driver.py::_build_action_agent`) assembles an
``AgentConfig`` and calls ``build_agent``. The gateway turn path does not
construct a persistent ``core.agent.Agent`` — gateway chat reuses one
``HeadlessAgent`` per logical session via ``SessionAgentPool`` (each turn
``bind_turn`` + live ``DefaultToolProvider`` from the chat session). When
``Agent.__init__``'s signature changes,
``agent_builder.py`` is the single edit site for harness surfaces that call
``build_agent``.

## Agent context and data stores

Turn assembly starts in ``turns/orchestrator.py`` with
``TurnSnapshot.from_session``.

**Do NOT** reintroduce per-surface `Agent` subclasses that override
`build_llm` / `build_system_prompt` / `build_tools` / `resolved_integrations`
hooks. Those hooks were removed because they let each surface hide per-turn
configuration on `self`, which diverged routing across surfaces.

## One agent shape

`core.agent.Agent` owns the ReAct loop (think → call tools → observe → answer).
A no-tool response is its accepted conclusion; hosts must not start a second
LLM to rewrite that answer.

### Contributor checklist (agent changes)

1. Update this file when harness rules change.
2. Inject action execution through the `ExecuteActions` port; do not import
   surface code into `agent_harness/`.
3. Public host API is `AgentSession.chat`.
   Adapters build `ChatTurnBindings` and call `dispatch_chat_turn` internally —
   never add a new top-level binder that calls `run_turn` directly.

**Read order for new code:** this file → `harness.py` (`AgentSession`) →
`turns/orchestrator.py` (`run_turn`) → `core/agent/agent.py` (facade + wiring)
→ `core/agent/react_loop.py` (`run_react_loop`, the tool-calling algorithm).

## Construct once → many turns

Prefer this shape in docs, samples, and new call sites — do **not** invent a
second top-level free function that dumps the turn stack, and do **not** rebuild
a headless agent on every message for the same logical session.

**Host API shape**

```python
from bootstrap.embedded import start_embedded_session

session = start_embedded_session()  # EMBEDDED_PROFILE + default agent
result = session.chat("…")  # turn 1
result = session.chat("…")  # turn 2 — same attached agent
```

``AgentSession.start`` must not import ``bootstrap`` (layer contract). Surfaces
that already ran another process profile call ``startup()`` (or pass an
explicit ``boot_process``).

**One agent per logical session (or scheduled loop)**

| Lifetime | Construct | Then |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Chat session (gateway + shell) | `TurnRunner` → `SessionAgentPool` keeps one `HeadlessAgent` per session id; each turn rebinds transport/TTY output via `BindableOutput.bind`, then `bind_turn` (session / accounting / console / tool_hooks) | `agent.handle(...)` (SessionGoal loop via `run_goal`) |
| Embedder / script | `start_embedded_session()` or `attach_agent(HeadlessAgent…)` once | repeated `chat` / `dispatch` |
| Scheduled loop | Prefer one agent for the loop’s lifetime when multi-turn; `run_headless_turn` is OK for true one-shot digests | do not treat one-shot as the multi-turn pattern |
| CLI `ask` | `AgentSession.start` once per invocation (ephemeral) | `.chat` once (`dispatch`) |

Same-session turns must not overlap on one pooled agent (gateway holds a
per-session lock). Different sessions stay concurrent under the capacity gate.

| Name | Use |
|------|-----|
| **`AgentSession`** + **`chat`** | **Public host API** — prefer in all new code |
| **`HeadlessAgent`** + **`handle`** | Gateway / shell per-message entry; thin wrapper over `run_goal` returning its last result |
| **`HeadlessAgent`** + **`run_goal`** | The one SessionGoal loop driver; `AgentSession.chat_until_goal` delegates here |
| **`HeadlessAgent`** + **`dispatch`** | One engine turn; what `AgentSession.chat` calls |
| **`SessionAgentPool`** | One headless agent per logical session across turns (gateway + shell) |
| **`DefaultHeadlessBuild`** | The default port family for one session; `.agent(tools=…, prompts=…)` builds the agent on it |
| **`resolve_agent_ports`** | Expand `AgentBuildConfig` → `(tools, prompts)` — shared by the pool and `build_shell_agent` |
| **`run_headless_turn`** | One-shot convenience for scheduler digests — not the multi-turn pattern |
| **`dispatch_chat_turn`** | **Internal** seam over `run_turn` — adapters only |

There is no `dispatch_message_to_headless_agent` — that free-function dump was
replaced by `HeadlessAgent.dispatch` / `AgentSession.chat`.

### Two doors into a turn (Concurrency & Serialization)

There are two ways into an agent turn:
1. **The Host Loop (`TurnRunner` → `HeadlessAgent.handle`)**:
   - Used by concurrent multi-actor hosts (**Gateway** transports and **Interactive Shell**).
   - Takes the `SessionAgentPool` per-session lock (serializing turns for the same session to prevent `AgentBusyError` and state corruption).
   - Takes the process turn capacity gate (`TurnConcurrencyGate` / `OPENSRE_MAX_CONCURRENT_TURNS`).
   - Drives the full `SessionGoal` outer loop (`run_goal`).
2. **Scripted / Headless API (`AgentSession.chat` / `chat_until_goal`)**:
   - The un-gated single-turn API for programmatic scripts (`main.py`, notebooks), tests, and single-shot CLI (`opensre ask`).
   - Deliberately kept as an unguarded entry point for single-tenant, scripted use.
   - **Forbidden for concurrent hosts:** Gateway and Shell modules must never call `chat()` or `chat_until_goal()` directly (enforced by `gateway/tests/test_harness_behaviour_border.py` and `tests/interactive_shell/test_harness_api_border.py`).

**Scaling** is separate from the host API: local concurrency
(`TurnConcurrencyGate` / transport pools / `OPENSRE_SIZE_PROFILE`) and cloud
Fargate scale-out (spin more tasks; same API per task) sit *around*
`chat`. Construct-once-per-session is the reuse story;
process/task scale-out is deploy. Do not redesign the host API to “enable
scaling.”

## Hosts, one AgentSession API

**Public host contract:** :class:`~core.agent_harness.harness.AgentSession`
with ``chat``. One name per concept — the former
``AgentHarness`` / ``HarnessConfig`` / ``HarnessStartupResult`` /
``dispatch_message`` aliases are deleted.

**Internal chat seam:** adapters build
:class:`~core.agent_harness.turns.chat_api.ChatTurnBindings`, then call
:func:`~core.agent_harness.turns.chat_api.dispatch_chat_turn` (thin facade
over ``run_turn``). Do **not** add new top-level chat entrypoints that call
``run_turn`` directly — adapters only. ``agent_harness`` must not import
``tools``.

| Host | Process boot | Host call |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Interactive shell | `configure_process(CLI_PROFILE)` + shell Rich adapters | `TurnRunner` → `SessionAgentPool` → `agent.handle` (TTY accounting / `is_tty=True`) |
| CLI `ask` | same CLI profile (already booted) | `AgentSession.start` → `.chat` (one-shot; `dispatch`) |
| Gateway chat | `configure_process(GATEWAY_PROFILE)` | `TurnRunner` → `SessionAgentPool` → `agent.handle` |
| Scheduled digests | adapters via profile; runners via `install_scheduler_runners` | `AgentSession.run_headless_turn` → `chat` |

Shell and gateway share the same turn host (`TurnRunner` + pool). The shell
passes TTY-aware accounting and `is_tty=True`; do **not** invent a parallel
REPL turn stack. `build_shell_agent` remains for tests and direct construction
characterization — production REPL submissions go through the pool.

## Keep the loop primitive in core

The ReAct loop primitive is `core.agent.Agent`. `agent_harness/` orchestrates it;
it does not re-implement it. Do not fork the loop here.

## core/agent package (Agent is a facade, not the algorithm owner)

`core/agent/` is a package with one file per responsibility. `Agent`
(in `agent.py`) is a thin facade: `__init__` stores construction-time config
and `run()` resolves per-run context (from `runtime_request=` or
`initial_messages=`) and hands it to `core.agent.react_loop.run_react_loop`,
which owns the actual think → call-tools → observe algorithm.

- `core/agent/mixins.py` — `EventEmitterMixin` (event dispatch),
  `ToolFilterMixin` (tool-narrowing hook), `SteeringMixin` (`steer`/`follow_up`
  to nudge a run in progress). `Agent` composes all three.
- `core/agent/provider_hooks.py` — `ProviderHookDelegate`, a fail-open wrapper
  around `core.provider.ProviderHooks` applied around each LLM call. A raised
  hook exception is logged and swallowed; it never breaks the loop.
- `core/agent/loop_host.py` — `LoopHost`, the `Protocol` `run_react_loop` calls
  back into. `Agent` implements it via the mixins plus its own
  `_transform_messages` / `_convert_to_llm` / `_before_request` /
  `_after_response` forwarders. The concrete `ProviderHookDelegate` type is an
  `Agent` implementation detail, not part of the host contract, so any host can
  wire those four provider hooks however it likes.
- `core/agent/run_io.py` — `AgentRunInput` (resolved per-run inputs) and
  `AgentRunResult` (the loop's outcome). `core.agent` re-exports `AgentRunResult`
  for the `from core.agent import AgentRunResult` path.
- `core/agent/react_loop.py` — `ReactLoop` (the loop as a method-object, phases
  `_think` / `_handle_conclusion` / `_observe`) and `run_react_loop` (its thin
  functional entry). A reply with no tool calls ends the turn unless a queued
  `follow_up` is waiting, or the host's `_should_accept_conclusion` rejects it
  (reviewed goals from `build_goal_reviewer`, including an unfinished task
  plan). Bare Goals without `verify` do not gate stop.
- `core/agent/agent.py` — the `Agent` facade: `__init__` (holds config), `run()`
  (builds the per-run `AgentRunInput` via `_build_run_input` and hands it to
  `run_react_loop`), and the `_should_accept_conclusion` / `_filter_tools`
  override hooks.

Do not reintroduce hook-method overrides on `Agent` itself (e.g. a subclass
overriding a private `_before_provider_request`-style method) — customize via
`provider_hooks=ProviderHooks(...)` at construction instead. Subclassing
remains the pattern for `_filter_tools` and `_should_accept_conclusion`, which
are genuine per-agent overrides, not seams `ProviderHooks` covers.
