"""Finish a merge that stopped on conflicts after a resolver edited the files.

Any caller that hands conflicted files to a coding agent uses the same three
steps: snapshot the stopped merge, check what the agent left unresolved, and
stage plus commit the merge. The caller decides what to do when files remain
unresolved (abort, or keep the merge in progress for a person).
