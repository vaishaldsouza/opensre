"""Queue an interactive selection menu for a decision the user must make.

Raw-stdin pickers cannot run mid-turn: the REPL keeps a ``prompt_async()`` open
concurrently, so arrow-key reads would race it and terminal CPR replies would
leak into the input line (same constraint as the deferred pickers in
``actions/slash.py``). This tool therefore stores the question as a
:class:`~core.agent_harness.session.pending_choice.PendingUserChoice` and queues
the literal ``/choose`` command, which the loop dispatches with exclusive stdin.
The selected option label is auto-submitted as the next user message.

Pass ``questions`` (label, title, options) when several facts block the work —
one payload, then STOP. After answers arrive, call ``update_plan`` and execute.
A single decision still uses ``title`` + ``options``.
