"""Lifecycle for resolving the conflicts of a git merge with a coding agent.

Snapshot the stopped merge, hand the conflicted files to the configured coding
agent (via the neutral ``integrations/coding_agent`` seam), verify that no
marker or unmerged path remains, show each hunk side by side, then, once the
shell's approval policy allows it, stage and commit the merge and push the
branch to the one it tracks. Files the agent could not settle are reported and
the merge is left in progress, so the user decides them; nothing is aborted.
